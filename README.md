# Overview
This repository provides source code and pre-trained models for brain tumor segmentation with BraTS dataset. The method is detailed in [1], and it won the 2nd place of MICCAI 2017 BraTS Challenge. 

This implementation is based on NiftyNet and Tensorflow. While NiftyNet provides more automatic pipelines for dataloading, training, testing and evaluation, this naive implementation only makes use of NiftyNet for network definition, so that it is lightweight and extensible. A demo that makes more use of NiftyNet for brain tumor segmentation is proivde [here][nfitynet_demo].

# Requirements
* A CUDA compatable GPU with memoery larger than 6GB is recommended for training. For testing only, a CUDA compatable GPU may not be required.

* Tensorflow. Install tensorflow following instructions from [https://www.tensorflow.org/install/][tensorflow_install].
[tensorflow_install]: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/

* NiftyNet. Install it by typing `pip install niftynet` or following instructions from [http://niftynet.io/][niftynet_io].
[niftynet_io]: http://niftynet.io/

* BraTS dataset. Data can be downloaded from [http://braintumorsegmentation.org/][brats_link].

# How to use
## 1, Prepare data
* Download BraTS dataset, and uncompress the file to `./data` folder. For example, the training set will be in `./data/Brats17TrainingData` and the validation set will be in `./data/Brats17ValidationData`.

* Process the data. Run `python pre_process.py`

## 2, Use pre-trained models
* Download pre-trained models from [here][model_download], and save these files in `./model_pretrain`.
[model_download]: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1moxSHiX1oaUW66h-Sd1iwaTuxfI-YlBA
* Obtain binary segmentation of whole tumors, run `python test.py config/test_wt.txt`.
* Obtain segmentation of all the tumor subregions, run `python test.py config/test_all_class.txt`.

## 3, How to train
The trainig process needs 9 steps, with axial view, sagittal view, coronal view for whole tumor, tumor core, and enhancing core, respectively.

The following commands are examples for these steps. However, you can edit the corresponding `*.txt` files for different configurations.

* Train models for whole tumor in axial, sagittal and coronal views respectively. run 

```bash
python train.py config/train_wt_ax.txt
python train.py config/train_wt_sg.txt
python train.py config/train_wt_cr.txt
```
* Train models for tumor core in axial, sagittal and coronal views respectively. run 

```bash
python train.py config/train_tc_ax.txt
python train.py config/train_tc_sg.txt
python train.py config/train_tc_cr.txt
```
* Train models for enhancing core in axial, sagittal and coronal views respectively. run 

```bash
python train.py config/train_en_ax.txt
python train.py config/train_en_sg.txt
python train.py config/train_en_cr.txt
```

## How to test
Similar to 'Use pre-trained models', write a configure file that is similar to `config/test_wt.txt` or `config/test_wt.txt` and set the value of model_file to your own model files. Run
```bash
python test.py your_own_config_for_test.txt
```
